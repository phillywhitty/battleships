## Deployment

### Heroku

The app was deployed via Heroku and the live link can be found here [Battleships Game](https:/)

-   To deploy the project through Heroku, the following steps were taken:
-   Sign up / Log in to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
-   From the main Heroku Dashboard, press the 'New' button and then press on the 'Create New App' button.
-   Give the project a name (Needs to be a unique name) and then select the region that is suitable to you. After this is done, press on the 'Create App' button.
-   Once the app has been created, you will be redirected to the deploy section. Using the submenu at the top, press on the settings button.
-   Once on the settings page, scroll down a to the 'Config vars' section. Once located, press on the 'Reveal congfig vars' button. This will reveal the current config vars for the app. There should not be any vars configured beforehand.
-   In the KEY input field, input PORT in capital letters and in the VALUE field, input 8000. Then click on the 'Add' button. This needs to be done for the Code Institute template. If you are not using the CI template, you may not need to do this.
-   Next, you need to click on the 'Add buildpack' button below. This should trigger a popup. Select Python as your first buildpack and press on the 'save changes' button.
-   Repeat the above step but this time select Node.js as the buildpack. The order of the buildpacks is important. Python should be first and Node.js second. If you accidently do them in the wrong order, you can click on either buildpacks and drag them to put them in the correct order.
-   Next, you need to navigate to the deploy page which you can do from the submenu at the top of the page.
-   Once on the deploy page, look for the deployment method section and press on the Github logo. Once done, a small section should appear underneath. Click on the 'Connect to GitHub' button. On your first time doing this, you may be promted to follow some steps which you should do.
-   Once done, a 'Connect to GitHub section should appear. Here you will need to search for the repository you want to connect to. You can either type in the repository name in the input field and press search or you can just press search right away and a list of all your repositories should appear and you can press on the one you would like to connect to. Once you have have found the repository you would like to connect to, press on the 'Connect' button on the right hand side.
-   Now that your app has been connected to GitHub, double check the 'Choose a branch deploy' drop down menu is deploying the correct branch from your GitHub Repository. Once you are sure, you need to decide if you would like to enable automatic deploys via the 'Enable Automatic Deploys' button below or if you would like to deploy it manually everytime. The difference is, with automatic deploy, your app will be updated automatically everytime you push the changes in GitHub where as with manual deploy, you will need to go back to the deploy page everytime you want to update the app with the changes. I prefer for it to be automatically done but it is entirely upto you.
-   Once you have decided how you want the deploys to be, press on the deploy branch below. Heroku will now build the app for you. Once it has been completed, a 'Your App Was Successfully Deployed' message will appear with a link the live site.
